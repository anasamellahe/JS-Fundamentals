# JS-Fundamentals

Welcome to the **JS-Fundamentals** repository!  
This project is designed to provide a strong foundation in JavaScript by walking through a set of tasks that focus on syntax, control structures, data types, and basic logic.

## 🚀 Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Understand why JavaScript is an amazing language.
- Run a JavaScript script using Node.js.
- Declare variables and constants using `let` and `const`.
- Explain the difference between `var`, `const`, and `let`.
- Identify all available JavaScript data types.
- Use conditional statements: `if`, `if ... else`.
- Write and use comments effectively.
- Assign and manipulate variable values.
- Create and use loops (`while`, `for`) effectively.
- Use `break` and `continue` within loops.
- Define and invoke functions.
- Understand what functions return when they don't explicitly return a value.
- Understand variable scope (local vs global).
- Use arithmetic operators.
- Work with dictionaries (JavaScript objects).
- Import code from other files using `require`.

## 📁 Repository Structure

This repo contains a series of standalone JavaScript files, each demonstrating a specific concept.

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `0-javascript_is_amazing.js` | Print a string using a constant variable |
| `1-multi_languages.js` | Print multiple strings using `console.log` |
| `2-arguments.js` | Print messages depending on the number of arguments |
| `3-value_argument.js` | Print the first argument or a default message |
| `4-concat.js` | Concatenate and print two arguments |
| `5-to_integer.js` | Convert an argument to an integer and print it |
| `6-multi_languages_loop.js` | Print multiple strings using a loop and an array |
| `7-multi_c.js` | Print "C is fun" a specified number of times |
| `8-square.js` | Print a square of "X" based on user input |
| `9-add.js` | Add two numbers using a function |

## 📝 Requirements

- All scripts must run using Node.js.
- No use of the `var` keyword is allowed.
- Each file is self-contained and uses `console.log(...)` for all outputs.
- All tasks avoid the use of external libraries.

---

## 📌 Usage

To run any script, use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
node <filename>
